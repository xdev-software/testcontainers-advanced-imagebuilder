/**
 * This package was forked from the OpenJDK (as of 21.0.7) to resolve a crash/infinite loop when encountering
 * <a href="https://github.com/xdev-software/testcontainers-advanced-imagebuilder/issues/155">
 * recursive NTFS junctions on Windows
 * </a>.
 * <p>
 * <b>Please note:</b>
 * Enabling it also requires adding ``--add-exports java.base/sun.nio.fs=ALL-UNNAMED`` or performance will be
 * impacted by 100x due non-accessible file attributes cache
 * </p>
